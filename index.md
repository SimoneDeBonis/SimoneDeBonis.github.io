### Hello!

I'm Simone, a Data Scientist from Italy working in the energy sector. I am deeply passionate about energy, finance, and quantitative modeling.

## What I'm Working On:
**Data Scientist** at Psaier Energies: I work in the energy trading department, where my main tasks include:
- Developing and monitoring models for Italian energy market forecasts and analysis.
- Migrating legacy data processes from on-premises to Azure.
- Analyzing data using Python and SQL.
- Creating Power BI dashboards for real-time monitoring and decision-making in energy trading.

## What I've Recently Done:
- **University Thesis**: Developed a Python program to integrate knowledge from various machine learning models to predict and understand engine failures for a leading automotive company.
- **Project Work** at [Big Data Lab](https://www.bigdata-lab.it): Utilized advanced machine learning techniques for multivariate anomaly detection of time series data obtained from server logs, which were properly preprocessed.
- **University Project**: Collaborated with colleagues to develop an early warning system using Support Vector Machine and Multi-Layer Perceptron models to prevent defaults in Italian municipalities.

Thank you for visiting! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. Many parts are still a work in progress. Enjoy your browsing!
